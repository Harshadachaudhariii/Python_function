Data science is the interdisciplinary study of data to extract knowledge and insights. 
It combines statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain expertise to analyze large,
complex datasets for decision-making and predictions. Key activities include data preparation, modeling, 
and visualization, often using programming languages like Python or R to find patterns and build models.
